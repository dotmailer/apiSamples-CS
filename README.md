.NET API samples
=========

This repository contains sample projects, in either .NET 2 or .NET 4, showing how to do some common tasks with the dotMailer APIs.

dotMailer has two flavours of API, which both can perform the same functions. There is an API that uses SOAP, and an API that is RESTful. You can choose to use either one, or even both, depending on which technology you prefer. 

Please be aware that the dotMailer API has [usage limits](http://api.dotmailer.com/) - please use bulk API methods where you can, and use the in-app API call debugger if you need to troubleshoot your integration.

We encourage pull requests - please do contribute if you have any updates or bug fixes for us!

#### Credentials

You can either use your own API credentials, or, if you wish, we have a demo set of credentials to help you learn how to use the API. These demo credentials will allow you to review a typical API response to each method or operation. However, this is not a sandbox - data sent using these demo credentials will not be persisted, and no emails will be sent in response to these API operations.

The credentials are:

Username: demo@apiconnector.com

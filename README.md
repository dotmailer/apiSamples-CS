.NET API samples
=========

This repository contains sample projects, in either .NET 2 or .NET 4, showing how to do some common tasks with the dotMailer APIs.

dotMailer has two flavours of API, which both can perform the same functions. There is an API that uses SOAP, and an API that is RESTful. You can choose to use either one, or even both, depending on which technology you prefer. 

Please be aware that the dotMailer API has [usage limits](http://api.dotmailer.com/) - please use bulk API methods where you can, and use the in-app API call debugger if you need to troubleshoot your integration.

We encourage pull requests - please do contribute if you have any updates or bug fixes for us!
